This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


# Let's experiment with R chunks and R Markdown.

You can write R code that acts like a calculator:

```{r}

3 + 5

7 - 200

8 * 234

1011 / 7

2 ** 5

```

Let's look at **operator precedence**.  

*PEMDAS* applies in R as well (parens, exponentiation, multiplication/division, addition/subtraction).


```{r}
100 - 20 / 2

( 100 - 20 ) / 2
```



Variables are used to store a value in a named memory location
```{r}
lbs_apples <- 5
price_per_pound <- 1.50
cost <- lbs_apples * price_per_pound


lbs_apples
price_per_pound
cost
```

I bought `r lbs_apples` pounds of apples   
at $`r price_per_pound` per pound   
for a total cost of $`r cost`.  

*I got a __great__ deal*.


You can update a variable.  Change the price to 1.75 and increase lbs by 2.
```{r}
price_per_pound <- 1.75
lbs_apples  <- lbs_apples + 2 
cost <- lbs_apples * price_per_pound

lbs_apples
price_per_pound
cost
```





# This is a heading level one.

## This is a heading level two.

## Unordered list (bulleted)

My favorite fruit:

* apples
  * honeycrisp
  * grannysmith
* pears
* bananas



## Ordered list (numbered)

My favorite fruit:

1. oranges
2. apples
    1. gala
    2. honeydew
    3. granny smith
3. peaches
3. pears
4. bananas

# Let's explore the cars dataset
```{r}
cars
```



The `dim` function lists the dataset dimensions (#rows, #cols)
```{r}
dim(cars)
```

The `nrow` function lists the number of rows/observations.
```{r}
nrow(cars)
```


The cars data set has `r nrow(cars)` observations on `r ncol(cars)` variables.


```{r}
# List the speed variable for each observation in the cars dataset
cars$speed
```


```{r}
min(cars$speed)  
mean(cars$speed)  #average
max(cars$speed)
```

The slowest speed is `r min(cars$speed)`, the fastest is `r max(cars$speed)`, and the average is `r mean(cars$speed)`.

The `'r median' is the middle value.  50% of observations are less than or equal to median, 50% are greater than or equal to.
```{r}
median(cars$speed)
```

6 number summary
```{r}
summary(cars$speed)
```

Let's create a new dataset using information from the class.
Two variables: typical hours of sleep on weekday, typical hours of sleep on Tuesday night, typical hours of sleep on Saturday night.
We will upload an excel spreadsheet.

```{r}
sleep <- read_csv("sleep.csv")
sleep
```

Display the observations for the Tuesday variable
```{r}
sleep$Tuesday
```

On average how many hours do students sleep on Tuesday?
```{r}
mean(sleep$Tuesday)
```

How about Saturday?
```{r}
mean(sleep$Saturday)
```

What is the difference between average hours on Saturday vs Tuesday?
```{r}
mean(sleep$Saturday) - mean(sleep$Tuesday)
```

Write a paragraph using embedded R to describe the statistics about the sample data set.
